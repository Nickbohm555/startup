## Who we Are
- TODO


## Starting the App
- 'npm install' or 'npm install --force' in local directory
- 'npm start' in local directory

## Current Demo
- We are done with the UI for now. Currently implementing the DB and Web3 Portion
- Here is a Sneak peak at some progress below:

## useful Git Commands for Developers on the Project:

1) SWITCHING BRANCHES
- git checkout <branchname>

2) MERGE VS REBASE
- Anytime we want to make one branch up to date with one ahead, do REBASE. 

3) REBASE EXAMPLE:
- example of <branch1> and <branch2>
- lets say <branch1> is ahead. Go to <branch2> and do: git rebase branch1

4) How to Fork & make Pull request (If you are a developer helping us out)
- Click fork in the top right corner
- Set up in Local repository
- create own branch to work on (git branch branch-name)
- make and commit changes (git add . git commit -m '')
- 'git push' to make changes in github
- go to project, click contribute and open pull request.


Problem Statement Slide:
Title: Creation of AI Strategy and Roadmap for a Custom LLM
Problem:
The Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of XYZ Bank has been tasked by the CEO to explore the potential of generative AI (Artificial Intelligence) and develop a winning strategy around it. The CEO was impressed by the possibilities of generative AI after their grandchild used it for homework. The CTO needs to address the following key questions:
* 		New Risks: What types of new risks will the bank face if it starts using generative AI?
* 		Competitive Differentiation: How can the bank stand out among competitors and those utilizing pre-existing generative AI models like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)?
* 		Implementation Recommendations: Should the bank implement generative AI for key processes and customer communications? What are the reasons for or against it?
Objectives:
The CTO seeks an AI strategy that focuses on proprietary Large Language Models (LLMs) to position XYZ Bank as a leader with differentiated AI capabilities. The following considerations should be addressed:
* 		Major LLMs Overview: Summarize the pros and cons of major LLMs currently available in the market.
* 		Resource Requirements: Explore the necessary resources for fine-tuning or developing a custom LLM.
* 		Research and Strategy: Conduct extensive research on rapidly evolving generative AI technology and develop a comprehensive strategy and action plan.
* 		Deliverable: Create a PowerPoint presentation with findings, including supporting datasets, Python libraries, development techniques, necessary architectures, and relevant examples.
* 		Success Criteria: Success will be measured based on the effectiveness in addressing the CTO's questions, the quality of the roadmap, and the likelihood of PwC being considered for a second phase of implementation assistance.
Note: While the CTO does not require a custom LLM, understanding the requirements for building one would be highly beneficial.
